# Team Full Stack Application Project

## Funventory Management System

The Funventory Management System app functions as a single page application using HTML and CSS for styling. The client side is written in Javascript with the jQuery library and Handlebars templating. The [back end](https://funventory.herokuapp.com/) is written utilizing Mongoose and a MongoDB database.

## Development Process

As our first team project, we hoped to build something that we could all be proud of.  We decided to create an inventory management system that could allow the manager of a grocery store to keep track of his or her products including product name, SKU number, department, and quantity.  We created a startup database with grocery items and allowed a manager to create an account, create an item to add to the database, update the quantity of that item and, finally, delete that item if necessary.

## User Stories
1. As a new employee, I should be able to sign up for an account so I can perform limited actions (search/update) on the inventory.
2. As a non-admin employee and manager, I should be able to search for an item based on SKU number, product name, or department.
3. As both a non-admin employee and manager, I should be able to update quantity.
4. As a manager, I want to view inventory levels to inform my business practices.
5. As a manager, I want to be able to delete a product in the case that we no longer stock that product.
6. As a manager, I want to be able to create a new product.
7. REACH: As a manager, I want to be alerted when an item gets to a certain quantity level so I can order more/less when needed.

## Check out the page

The application was deployed on gitHub pages [at this address](https://github.com/Uchiha-Satori/front-end-team-project).

The back end repository is located [here](https://github.com/Uchiha-Satori/back-end-team-project).

## Unsolved Problems and Reach Goals

1. Smartphone compatibility: We would like to test the page on mobile devices to ensure the app is still functional and user friendly

2. Search feature: We would like to create an option on the page for the user to be able to search for an item by SKU number and/or product name.
